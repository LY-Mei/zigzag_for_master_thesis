Contributing guidelines
=======================

When contributing to the framework, please consider the following guidelines:

* Use Google's `Python Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_
* Use Google docstrings to document your classes, functions, methods, .... Examples can be found throughout the code and `here <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
* Update the documentation accordingly

Documentation
=============

When adding new functionality, it's mandatory to document what this does, how it achieves this, and how to use the newly added functionality.
Explicit documentation resides in the `docs/` folder, using the `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ format (.rst).

Writing new documentation
-------------------------

When writing new documentation, decide if it would best fit in an existing document, or in a new one. If you decide to create a new file, create this file under docs/source/ and use lower-case letters with a hyphen (-) in between words. After writing the new file, you need to add it to the `toctree` in `docs/source/index.rst`.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The documentation is build using Sphinx. You should install both sphinx and sphinx-press-theme, which is easy through the requirements.txt file provided in `docs/`.


.. code-block:: sh

    cd docs/
    pip install -r requirements.txt

After, you can build the documentation using the provide Makefile (Linux). For Windows, you can run the ``make.bat`` file.

.. code-block:: sh

    make html

In the future, this will be automated through Github Actions.
